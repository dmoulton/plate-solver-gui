#### PlateSolver

This app is just a small GUI frontend for a local astrometry.net install. It will allow you to placesolve an image and get basic info along with an annotated image. Handy for seeing the pixel resolution or the rotation.

### Requirements

You must have a local functional astrometry.net install. If it is working command line, this app should work as well. Follow the instructions for your platform to install and get it running.
